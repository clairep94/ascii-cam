This is a webcam to ASCII converter that runs on p5js

## WHAT I LEARNED
-[X] How to set up a webcame feed
-[X] How images are stored as a matrix of pixels (array of R, G, B integer values)
-[X] How to convert colour pixels into B/W pixels by averaging the R, G, B values of each pixel
-[X] How to map B/W pixels to ASCII characters of different densities

## FUTURE LEARNING & IMPLEMENTATION
- [ ] How to compile p5js & run this program on another website
- [ ] Raspberry pi project --> implementing the same logic in python to run on a pi camera
- [ ] Storing the converted feed into different file formats (static image formats, text files)
